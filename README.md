Fudging Ionic
=====================

An attempt to learn Ionic Framework.

## Using this project

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
$ ionic start newProject
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page.

## Installation

While we recommend using the `ionic` utility to create new Ionic projects, you can use this repo as a barebones starting point to your next Ionic app.

To use this project as is, first clone the repo from GitHub, then run:

```bash
$ cd ionic-app-base
$ sudo npm install -g cordova ionic gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp install
```

## Updating Ionic

To update to a new version of Ionic, open bower.json and change the version listed there.

For example, to update from version `1.0.0-beta.4` to `1.0.0-beta.5`, open bower.json and change this:

```
"ionic": "driftyco/ionic-bower#1.0.0-beta.4"
```

This is a personal learning project, and things might not work as intended.
